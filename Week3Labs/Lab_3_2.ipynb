    "One of the simplying assumptions that is made with Naïve Bayes classification is that each document is taken to be a so-called **bag of words**.

This means that we do not taking into account the number of times a word appears in a document.   Each variable (i.e., word) has two possible values -- `True` if it occurs and `False` if it does not.  Note that there are **multinomial** variants of Naïve Bayes where the number of times a words appears in a document is taken into account, but we will not consider that case here.\n",
